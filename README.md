* A database.sqlite3 file is required to save the data

* Another note is that wiki links are created using the original markdown syntax: \[link_name\](url). In this case the url must contain: "/page/:title" to be able to navigate to a link

## Running the app locally

``` bash
$ npm install
$ npm start (or npm run dev to run nodemon)
```
    
open localhost:3000
